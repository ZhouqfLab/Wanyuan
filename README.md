something work about relation extraction
First work :FSCL: A Joint Framework of Few-Shot Contrastive Learning Representation in Relation Extraction

You can view our work in the following link in overleaf:  [link](https://www.overleaf.com/2536835227fncnpytdgjwm#27c35f) 


Our code are available at :[link](https://github.com/JohnnyGWY/FSCL) 

To evaluate FSCL framwork, we conduct experiments on 5 RE publice datasets, including SEMEVAL, DialogRE, TACRED-Revisit, Re-TACRE and TACRED. You can download them via this [datasets link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BQW3ekxJ96w2652FndRtcEIHp6Gwy_py/view?usp=sharing)
